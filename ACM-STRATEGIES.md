## Simple ACM Strategies to use ##
<ol>
<li>Use a divide-and-conquer strategy:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Have each team member independently work on a problem they think they can solve</li>
	<li>Have each team member write pseudocode to implement their solution</li>
	<li>Implement the pseudocode in the language of choice for that problem (ex a computation problem may be written by a math or physics expert in Python while another problem may be implemented in Java by someone knowledgeable with that language)</li>
	<li>If you need help debugging, print out the problem and look over the hardcopy while your teammates implement the solutions to their problems.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, print out a hardcopy and have your teammates look over it while you implement their pseudocode</li>
	</ol>
<li>When solving particularly complex problems, it can be beneficial to have the entire team focus on that problem and talk it over. However, you should try to solve as many other problems as possible first</li>
</ol>
