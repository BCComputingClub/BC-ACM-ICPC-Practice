This zip file contains the problem set from the 2015 MidAtlantic
Regional.

It incorporates the following changes from the problem set as
distributed to the teams:

* problem A: The word "strictly" has been added (i.e., "strictly
  increasing") in accordance with a clarification issued to teams.

* problem F: A note has been added explaining that this problem was
  withdrawn from the contest in a decision made after the problem sets
  had been distributed to the site judges for printing.

* problem F: In case anyone wishes to use this problem for practice
  anyway, a stipulation that each city can only be visited once has
  been added. If we had gone ahead and used the problem, this would
  have been a necessary clarification.
